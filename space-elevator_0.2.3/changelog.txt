Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2025-11-26
  Features:
    - Per-elevator transfer rate selector in Transfer tab
        - Choose between 10, 25, 50, 100, or 250 items per transfer cycle
        - Higher rates transfer more items but cost more energy
        - Beam width scales with transfer rate for visual feedback
    - Energy cost system for item transfers
        - Each item transferred costs 10kJ of energy
        - Energy cost displayed in Transfer tab GUI
        - Live display of available vs required energy
        - Transfers skip when energy is insufficient
  Technical:
    - Per-elevator transfer_rate storage with save migration
    - Energy drain happens after transfer based on actual items moved
    - GUI live refresh includes energy status updates

Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2025-11-26
  Features:
    - Transfer beam visual effects - colored beams appear when items/fluids are transferred
        - Surface side: beam shoots upward from elevator into the sky
        - Platform side: beam shoots up from below, visible in empty space under the platform
    - Different beam colors for transfer types:
        - Item upload: Blue
        - Item download: Orange
        - Fluid upload: Cyan/teal
        - Fluid download: Dark orange
    - Dynamic platform edge detection for accurate beam positioning
    - Beam width scales with transfer amount (wider beams for more items)
  Technical:
    - New visual-effects.lua script module for rendering effects
    - Platform bottom edge caching (5-second cache) for performance
    - Beam rendering uses LuaRendering.draw_line with dual-layer effect (outer + inner core)
    - Persistent beam management - beams stay visible during continuous transfers

Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2025-11-26
  Features:
    - Debug button to skip construction (for testing) - appears in Construction tab
    - Fluid transfer UI in Transfer tab with status display and manual transfer buttons
    - Custom GUI for Space Elevator Dock showing all 48 inventory slots
  Changes:
    - Elevator fluid tank now spawns 6 tiles north of elevator (visible, accessible for pipes)
    - Materials tab now shows interactive inventory when elevator is operational
    - Improved fluid status messages to distinguish between "no tank" and "empty tank"
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Materials tab not showing inventory after construction complete
    - Fixed Factorio 2.0 inventory iteration (get_contents returns array not dictionary)
    - Fixed dock inventory display only showing 10 slots instead of 48
    - Fixed fluid transfer buttons not appearing in Transfer tab
    - Fixed misleading "place Dock Fluid Tank" message when tank was empty
    - Fixed Transfer tab resetting to Status tab when clicking transfer buttons
    - Fixed slot counting showing item types instead of actual slots (7 stacks now shows 7, not 1)
    - Fixed "Only callable on tabbed-pane" GUI crash when opening elevator
    - Added live updates to Transfer tab inventory/fluid counts without resetting active tab
